0.0.1 Initial release
0.0.2 Make available the source code
0.0.3 Changes in the `PointerType.name`. Array types quoted for the better readability. Eg. `(char[10])*` means a pointer to `char[10]`. 
0.0.4 Removed `BinaryTypeHelper.typeDef()`
0.0.4 Added `BinaryTypes.typeDef()`
0.0.4 Added `BinaryTypes.declare()`
0.0.5 Initial support of `binary declartions`. Declarations through the special header files from now supports the `typedef` types, `struct` and `union` declarations
0.0.5 Removed getter `BinaryData.location`
0.0.5 Added field `BinaryData.base`
0.0.5 Added field `BinaryData.offset`  
0.0.5 Removed operator `BinaryData.operator~)`
0.0.5 Removed class `Reference` in favor of the "all-sufficient" implementation of the `Binary Data` 
0.0.6 Made adaptations to the new version of package `binary_declarations`
0.0.7 Completely reimplemented the mechanics of naming of the binary types. Now types displayed correctly
0.0.8 Completely reimplemented the integer type system fully compatible with the basic C language types
0.0.8 Completely reimplemented the compatibility type checking mechanics. Now it faster and more accurate and compromise between C and C++ languages
0.0.9 Fixed bugs in forming names of the binary types
0.0.9 Breaking change: `FunctionType` now requires parameter `name`
0.0.10 Added new concept: type members. Concept actual for `enum`, `struct` and `union` types
0.0.10 Added experimental support of `enum` binary type
0.0.10 Breaking change: Members of `StructureType` (`struct` and `enum`) now are `StructureMember` instead to be of just a `BinaryTypes`. They holds the information about `name`, `type` and `offset`
0.0.11 Initial support of `enum` binary type
0.0.12 Added field `BinaryType.original`
0.0.12 Added field `BinaryTypes.types`
0.0.14 Better error messages in `BinaryTypes.declare()` about problems in binary declarations 
0.0.15 Added support for macro processing
0.0.16 Completely reimplemented the structural types. Introduced the concept of the `storage units` for compatibility of the `libffi` library   
0.0.16 Initial support of `bit-fields`. Currently only declaration without an access/modification (will be added later)
0.0.16 Added more compatibility with C99 standard. Flexible arrays, declaration and behavior of the bit-fields, behavior of the packed structural types
0.0.16 Slightly reduced the dependence on `unsafe_extension` through the new concept of the `_PhysicalData`. `_PhysicalData` implements `ByteData` with unlimited length (for preventing the overhead on the data manipulation with a large data massives with the length greater than the size of `Smi`)
0.0.17 Class `BinaryTypes` was freed from the all public members (except the members that represent primitive types). From now it ready for use as the base container class for descendant binary types with the members that represent the declared types as members by their names (synonyms)
0.0.17 Function `BinaryTypes.declare()` was moved to `BinaryTypeHelper.declare()`
0.0.17 Initial support of `attributes`
0.0.17 Implementation support of the attributes `aligned` and `packed` almost completed
0.0.18 Made adaptations to the new version of package `binary_declarations`
0.0.19 Significant rework of the implementation of the performing the type declarations. The support of the attributes `aligned` and `packed` was implemented and was tested
0.0.19 The predefined values available now in the declarations environment. Currently this is `__OS__` `__BITNESS__`
0.0.20 Function `BinaryTypeHelper.declare()` returns now the `Declarations`. This should prevent an unnecessary double parsing of the declarations in `binary_interop` 
0.0.21 Added possibility to import previously declared types into the new binary types. This allows reuse already the declared binary types
0.0.21 Breaking changes. Class `BinaryTypes` was freed from the the members that represent primitive types. From now the class `BinaryTypes` is a lightweight class without any public members 
0.0.22 Made adaptations to the new version of package `binary_declarations`
0.0.23 Initial support of the `_Bool` binary type
0.0.23 Completely reimplemented class `_Declarations`
0.0.23 Reimplemented the `structural` and the `enumeration` classes to the full support of the declaring type synonyms in the `typedef` declarations
0.0.23 Made adaptations to the new version of package `binary_declarations`    
0.0.25 Added support for obtaining the symbol tables during the parsing declarations in `BinaryTypeHelper.declare()`. Into the corresponding symbol tables will be added functions and variables
0.0.27 Made adaptations to the new version of package `binary_declarations`
0.0.29 Fixed minor bug in the `scope` resolution of the elaborated types
