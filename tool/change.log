0.0.1 Initial release
0.0.2 Make available the source code
0.0.3 Changes in the `PointerType.name`. Array types quoted for the better readability. Eg. `(char[10])*` means a pointer to `char[10]`. 
0.0.4 Removed `BinaryTypeHelper.typeDef()`
0.0.4 Added `BinaryTypes.typeDef()`
0.0.4 Added `BinaryTypes.declare()`
0.0.5 Initial support of `binary declartions`. Declarations through the special header files from now supports the `typedef` types, `struct` and `union` declarations
0.0.5 Removed getter `BinaryData.location`
0.0.5 Added field `BinaryData.base`
0.0.5 Added field `BinaryData.offset`  
0.0.5 Removed operator `BinaryData.operator~)`
0.0.5 Removed class `Reference` in favor of the "all-sufficient" implementation of the `Binary Data` 
0.0.6 Made adaptations to the new version of package `binary_declarations`
0.0.7 Completely reimplemented the mechanics of naming of the binary types. Now types displayed correctly
0.0.8 Completely reimplemented the integer type system fully compatible with the basic C language types
0.0.8 Completely reimplemented the compatibility type checking mechanics. Now it faster and more accurate and compromise between C and C++ languages
0.0.9 Fixed bugs in forming names of the binary types
0.0.9 Breaking change: `FunctionType` now requires parameter `name`
0.0.10 Added new concept: type members. Concept actual for `enum`, `struct` and `union` types
0.0.10 Added experimental support of `enum` binary type
0.0.10 Breaking change: Members of `StructureType` (`struct` and `enum`) now are `StructureMember` instead to be of just a `BinaryTypes`. They holds the information about `name`, `type` and `offset`
0.0.11 Initial support of `enum` binary type
